# Example of refinement in TLA+
Proof of the refinement from my PhD implemented.

This example contains an abstract model of signal exchange according to the rendezvous model and implementation in PlusCal that refines the abstract model.

In my PhD dissertation, this example shows that proposed actions for signal exchanges can be translated in C. However, such generated code should never be used as an executable program, but instead, it can be added to the program under verification to be analyzed by a  static verification tool.
